Deep Reinforcement Learning: Training an AI to Play Snake
Overview
This project demonstrates how to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to play the classic Snake game. The project is divided into two main components:

Snake Game: A Python-based Snake game using Pygame.
DRL Agent: An AI agent trained using TensorFlow (Keras) to learn and play the Snake game autonomously.
The project is designed as an educational tool, particularly for beginners who want to explore Reinforcement Learning concepts and apply them to a real-world scenario.

Features
Customizable Game Environment: Modify game parameters such as speed, block size, and more.
Deep Reinforcement Learning Implementation: Train an agent using deep learning techniques to improve its performance in playing Snake.
Pre-trained Model: A pre-trained model is provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the AI.
Interactive Interface: Visualize the learning process and the agentâ€™s performance in real-time.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pygame
numpy
tensorflow (with Keras)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copier le code
pip install pygame numpy tensorflow
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/AymaneD2000/Deep-reinforcement-learning-in-snake-game-using-tensorflow
cd Deep-reinforcement-learning-in-snake-game-using-tensorflow
Running the Game
You can run the Snake game without the AI by executing:

bash
Copier le code
python snake_game.py
To train the AI agent and see it play the game, run:

bash
Copier le code
python train_agent.py
Pre-trained Model
A pre-trained model is available in the models directory. You can load and test this model using:

bash
Copier le code
python play_with_model.py
How It Works
Snake Game
The Snake game is implemented using Pygame, where the player controls a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body. The snake grows longer with each food item consumed.

DRL Agent
The AI agent is trained using Deep Q-Learning, a variant of Q-learning that uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function. The agent receives rewards based on its actions (positive for collecting food, negative for collisions), and over time, it learns to maximize its score by improving its decision-making process.

Training Process
The training process involves the following steps:

State Representation: The game state (e.g., position of the snake, food, direction) is converted into a format that the neural network can process.
Action Selection: The agent selects an action (move forward, turn left, turn right) based on its policy.
Reward Calculation: The agent receives a reward depending on the outcome of the action.
Learning: The agent updates its policy based on the rewards received, gradually improving its performance.
